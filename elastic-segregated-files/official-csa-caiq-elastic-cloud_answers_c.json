This is the overall process of developing, implementing, and retiring information systems through a multistep process from initiation, analysis, design, implementation, and maintenance to disposal. The process consists of a series of defined steps or phases where information security must be integrated into the SDLC to ensure appropriate protection for the Elastic information that the system transmits, processes, and stores.",
