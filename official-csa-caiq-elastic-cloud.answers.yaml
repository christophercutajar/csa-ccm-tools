      A formal systems development life cycle (SDLC) methodology is in place. This is the overall process of developing, implementing, and retiring information systems through a multistep process from initiation, analysis, design, implementation, and maintenance to disposal. The process consists of a series of defined steps or phases where information security must be integrated into the SDLC to ensure appropriate protection for the Elastic information that the system transmits, processes, and stores.

      This internal SDLC program that is built around our unique open source development model. We ensure our developers are aware of common security problems, how to identify and resolve them, as well as how to report such problems to the appropriate teams for remiation and verification. Changes are vetted by multiple security aware reviewers. We have programs in place to understand third party components, track known issues in them as well as updating the components as needed. Releases receive scrutiny to identify any issues in the supply chain and product itself. We are a CVE CNA and publish security alerts as part of the overall lifecycle program. We regularly conduct 3rd party code reviews of our products, have a private bug bounty program, and accept external reports from anyone regarding the security of our software.

      Deployment to production is controlled via Change Management.
      - Changes are branches in repository, version controlled.
      - All changes are automatically tested by a pipeline of tools including security checks.
      - All testing is registered in GitHub and must pass before testing is complete.
      - To merge new code into production, needs approval by another developer/engineer.

      Elastic uses data integrity controls to ensure that data inputs to application systems are accurate and within the expected range of values.

      Where appropriate, data inputs are sanitized or otherwise rendered safe before being inputted to an application system.

      Input and output integrity routines such as SHA hashes and checksums are used throughout our platform and application code to prevent processing errors and corruption.

      Access to in-scope system components is determined by role and based on least privilege.

      All access is terminated within 24 hours of an employee leaving the company and tracked via a ticketing system.

      In addition, quarterly user access reviews are performed by functional leaders for the in-scope system components to ensure that access is restricted appropriately. Access removal is tracked to remove access as necessary in a timely manner.

      Authorized Elastic employees are only provided access to tenant data where this is required to help deliver the service.

      Backup snapshots are taken on a per-deployment basis and are configurable by the customer. The default snapshot interval is 30 minutes. Customers can restore data to the same or a different deployment on-demand and without involvement from Elastic.

      High Availability is achieved within the selected region by hosting the deployment in multiple availability zones. This is configurable by the customer and enabled by default. Elastic recommends that Production deployments are in at least two availability zones.

      Elastic Cloud customers have access to delete data at thier own discretion and at any time without the involvement of Elastic.

      All administrators are educated on their legal responsibilities with regard to security and data integrity. Security and privacy awareness training is completed during new hire onboarding activities and then annually after initial hire. They also are required to follow the requirements outlined in the InfoSec009 Data Classification Standard. This data classification standard enables Elastic to categorize the information that it processes for efficient use and protection. By identifying the at types of data that Elastic processes, how and by whom the data is used and where the data is stored, Elastic can better develop policies and procedures to prevent the misuse of sensitive information.
      Elastic users are required to use the standard to classify the data they handle, process, and store to ensure Elastic implements adequate security measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data.

      Firewalls are in place to filter unauthorized inbound traffic from the internet and deny any type of incoming network connection that is not explicitly authorized. Further network segmentation and firewalling is in place between logical zones within the environment.

      Elastic Cloud customers can further restrict traffic to their deployments by using our traffic filtering functionality or by configuring PrivateLink.

      All access by Elastic personnel to the Elastic Cloud infrastructure is performed via an IPSec VPN with multi-factor authentication (MFA). Firewalls prevent any access from taking place without the VPN. Role based access control (RBAC) is in place following the principle of least privilege.

      All access to the production environment is logged, monitored and audited at multiple levels. Access to tenant data is logged at a granular level, down to individual operating system commands or API calls that are attributable to an individual. Automatic alerting is in place, with documented response procedures for the InfoSec team to act on alerts.

      Elastic Cloud customers have control over their content including the ability to manage snapshots.

      Backup snapshots are taken on a per-deployment basis and are configurable by the customer. The default snapshot interval is 30 minutes. Customers can restore data to the same or a different deployment on-demand and without involvement from Elastic. This functionality could be used to move one or more snapshots into litigation hold without affecting other customers.

      Elastic does not provide any government with direct or unfettered access to customer data. Elastic releases only specific data mandated by the relevant legal demand. If a government wants customer data for any purpose it needs to follow the applicable legal process, meaning it must serve us with a court order for content or a subpoena for account information.

      If compelled to disclose customer data, we will promptly notify you and provide a copy of the demand, unless legally prohibited from doing so. We respond only to requests for specific accounts and identifiers. There is no blanket or indiscriminate access to Elastic’s customer data.

      Elastic do not automatically upgrade Elastic Cloud deployments. Customers have the flexibility to upgrade to any available version on a per-deployment basis from the Elastic Cloud console.

      Customers are notified of security vulnerabilities in Elastic products at: https://www.elastic.co/community/security

      In the case that an identified weakness or vulnerability would have a material impact on customers, we may perform an additional communication advising customers to upgrade their deployments.

      Mobile code is not used in Elastic Cloud.

      The use of mobile code in the form of custom Elasticsearch plugins is only available to Platinum level customers. Use of the plugin must be requested by the customer and specifically authorized by Elastic Support before being enabled, in which case it is enabled only for the specific deployment specified by the customer.
