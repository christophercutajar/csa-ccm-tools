The process consists of a series of defined steps or phases where information security must be integrated into the SDLC to ensure appropriate protection for the Elastic information that the system transmits, processes, and stores.\n\nThis internal SDLC program that is built around our unique open source development model. We ensure our developers are aware of common security problems, how to identify and resolve them, as well as how to report such problems to the appropriate teams for remiation and verification. Changes are vetted by multiple security aware reviewers. We have programs in place to understand third party components, track known issues in them as well as updating the components as needed. Releases receive scrutiny to identify any issues in the supply chain and product itself. We are a CVE CNA and publish security alerts as part of the overall lifecycle program. We regularly conduct 3rd party code reviews of our products, have a private bug bounty program, and accept external reports from anyone regarding the security of our software.",
